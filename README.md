### ðŸŒ¸ Tsunade 

This project started as a port of [lite](https://github.com/rxi/lite) to GPU.  
After being successfully ported, we are now entering the second phase of development:  
transforming the original lite editor into something closer to **nvim + plugins**, but with **Notepad-like motions**.

### Goals
- [ ] Unbloat the original project  
  *(this doesnâ€™t mean the original is bloated, only that we will remove features we wonâ€™t use)*  
- [ ] Use **Tree-sitter** as the syntax highlighting engine  
- [ ] Implement a **Telescope-like file searcher**  
- [ ] Add **Airline-style visuals**  
- [ ] Provide **fast access to user settings** through a Lua file for easy modification  
- [ ] Enable **theme previews**  
- [ ] Support **scaling with scroll**  
- [ ] Make the editor more lock-themed on japanese style
